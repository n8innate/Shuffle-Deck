# Shuffle-Deck
A basic app to render and shuffle a deck of cards

---
## **To Start**

In order to start up the application

1. Change directory `cd ./shuffle-deck/` into your terminal
2. Run `npm start`

A page should open shortly displaying a list of playing cards

## **Instructions**

Right now the shuffle function does not actually shuffle the cards. Update App.js to add shuffle functionality.
